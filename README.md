# In No Particular Order 

### @vmanot

#### AirPods <> FaceTime interaction increasingly becoming an open joke.

#### `lldb` being unable to inspect local Swift variables in 2024. Swift was released almost a decade ago.

#### Entirety of Xcode's "Add Package Dependencies" UI. The search bar's text input still missing a debounce despite years into release.

#### `StartDiveIntent`. (SiriKit overall along with the gutting AppleScript about 5-7 years too early). 

#### Messages app search indexing (or lack thereof).

#### Xcode

#### [Dev-rel around SwiftSyntax's coupling with SwiftPM](https://forums.swift.org/t/compilation-extremely-slow-since-macros-adoption/67921/68)

### @dimillian

#### `List` There is still no definitive way to keep the scroll position

#### `List` Prepending items while scrolling makes the list lag and loses its position

#### `List` Micro stuttering even with simple row views 

#### `List` No control over animations when updating the state

### @rdev

#### `NSTrackingSeparatorToolbarItem` which was added the same year SwiftUI app lifecycle released, is still not available from SwiftUI.

#### Focus state management in SwiftUI. Or out of SwiftUI. Anything to do with responder chain in macOS feels intentionally designed to traumatize developers.

### @parth220

#### Apple Developer Enrollment can happen on MacOS, iPhone, and Web. The enrollment processing state machine is nondeterministic. Verification is hit or miss, some people get double charged, random delays on account activation.

### @PatrikTheDev

#### If you have an expired payment method before starting Family Sharing and are _not_ the organizer, Apple will not let you pay for a Developer Membership (because your card is expired) but they also will not let you change it (generic error message).

PRs welcomed (merging is at the discretion of my personal amusement).

Be civil. **Do not** target people. Highlight the obscene.
